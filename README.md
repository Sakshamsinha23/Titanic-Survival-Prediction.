## Introduction
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. This project uses the Titanic dataset to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on features such as age, sex, class, etc.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is available on Kaggle. It includes information about the passengers, such as their age, sex, ticket class, and whether they survived.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using pip:



## Exploratory Data Analysis
In this section, we perform EDA to understand the dataset better. We check for missing values, outliers, and perform basic statistical analysis.

## Data Visualization
We use various visualization techniques to understand the relationships between different features and the target variable (Survived). Some of the visualizations include:

Distribution of passengers by class
Survival rate by gender
Age distribution of survivors and non-survivors
Machine Learning Model
We build a Logistic Regression model to predict the survival of passengers. The steps include:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
Model Training: Training the Logistic Regression model on the training dataset.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Results
The Logistic Regression model achieved an accuracy of 94% on the test dataset. The modelâ€™s performance metrics are as follows:

Precision: 0.93
Recall: 0.92
F1-Score: 0.93
Conclusion
The Logistic Regression model performed well in predicting the survival of Titanic passengers. Further improvements can be made by exploring other machine learning algorithms and feature engineering techniques.
